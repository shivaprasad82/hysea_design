We have designed a wireframe for project and also a website which acts as platform connecting the Companies/Organisations ,
Placement Officers of college , Faculty , Students which helps them to find matching jobs for their profile.

The client side is made up of the Android mobile application and the web application. The mobile
application contains personality test questions that the students are required to answer. The score
of the test is used to give career possibilities to the student and then go ahead and view professional
testimonials associated with each career. The web application is used for administration purposes
to manage users, careers and professional testimonials. Both the mobile and web application are
connected to an online server through the internet. The server is then connected to an online
database where the users, professionals and career details resides.
